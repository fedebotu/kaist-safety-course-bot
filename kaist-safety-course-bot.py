KAIST Safety Course Automatic Viewer

This bot makes viewing the (quite annoying) lab safety videos automatic, so you don't have to click 
many times on the videos that you need to see to complete the course :D

Please read the README.md file for more information on Github:
https://github.com/fedebotu/kaist-safety-course-bot
